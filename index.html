                        Lionel Messi won his first major trophy with Argentina last Saturday night.

                        The Barcelona superstar's country secured a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the final of the 2021
                        Copa America thanks to a first half goal from Angel Di Maria.

                        It was an emotional evening for Messi and his beloved country, as it brought an end to their
                        dismal run in finals of major international tournaments.

                        Prior to their success at the Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Argentina had lost their last
                        four finals, including three in three years between 2014 and 2016.

                        But the trophy drought is finally over and the South American nation's latest triumph was the
                        38th title of Messi's incredible career.

                        That means the 34-year-old is now third in the list of players with the most trophies won in the 21st century.

Messi is now three clear of his eternal rival Cristiano Ronaldo and is only four away from equalling the total of the man currently occupying top spot.

Let's take a look at the top 10 in full, as provided by the ever-reliable Transfermarkt.
